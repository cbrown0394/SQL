--I worked with a dataset called chinook, which represents a digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.

--#1 Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. 
--(Hint: != or <> can be used to say "is not equal to").
SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerID, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country <> 'US';


--#2 Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT *
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

--#3 Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. 
--The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, 
--and billing country.
SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, inv.InvoiceId, inv.InvoiceDate, inv.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.customers cust
    JOIN chinook.invoices inv
    ON cust.CustomerID = inv.CustomerId
WHERE inv.BillingCountry = 'Brazil';


--#4 Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT *
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE title LIKE '%agent%';


--#5 Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices
;


--#6 Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. 
--The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
SELECT inv.InvoiceId, emp.LastName, emp.FirstName
FROM chinook.customers cust
    JOIN chinook.invoices inv
    ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
    JOIN chinook.employees emp
    ON emp.EmployeeId = cust.SupportRepId
WHERE emp.title LIKE '%agent%';


--#7 Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
SELECT inv.total, cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, inv.BillingCountry, emp.LastName, emp.FirstName
FROM chinook.customers cust
    JOIN chinook.invoices inv
    ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
    JOIN chinook.employees emp
    ON emp.EmployeeId = cust.SupportRepId;
    

--#8 How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(InvoiceId)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '%2009%';


--#9 What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT SUM(total)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '%2009%';


--#10 Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT tracks.Name, items.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.invoice_items items
    JOIN chinook.tracks tracks
    ON items.TrackId = tracks.TrackId;
    

--#11 Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT items.InvoiceLineId, tracks.Name AS Track_Name, art.Name AS Artist_Name
FROM chinook.albums alb
    JOIN chinook.artists art
    ON alb.ArtistId = art.ArtistId
    JOIN chinook.tracks tracks
    ON tracks.AlbumId = alb.AlbumId
    JOIN chinook.invoice_items items
    ON items.TrackId = tracks.TrackId;
    

--#12 Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.
SELECT tracks.Name AS Track_Name, albums.Title AS Album_Title, media.Name AS Media_Type, genres.Name AS Genre
FROM chinook.tracks tracks
    JOIN chinook.media_types media
    ON media.MediaTypeId = tracks.MediaTypeId
    JOIN chinook.genres genres
    ON genres.GenreId = tracks.GenreId
    JOIN chinook.albums albums
    ON albums.AlbumId = tracks.AlbumId;
    

--#13 Show the total sales made by each sales agent.
SELECT emp.LastName, emp.FirstName, SUM(inv.Total) AS Total
FROM chinook.invoices inv
    JOIN chinook.customers cust
    ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
    JOIN chinook.employees emp
    ON emp.EmployeeId = cust.SupportRepId
GROUP BY emp.LastName;


--#14 Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
SELECT emp.LastName, emp.FirstName, SUM(inv.Total) AS Total
FROM chinook.invoices inv
    JOIN chinook.customers cust
    ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
    JOIN chinook.employees emp
    ON emp.EmployeeId = cust.SupportRepId
WHERE inv.InvoiceDate LIKE '%2009%'
GROUP BY emp.LastName
ORDER BY Total DESC LIMIT 1;
